# Architecture:
- This project is using an MVVM architecture heavily relying on LiveData, Dagger, and RxJava2. 
- Any Written code from Chillieman is done in Kotlin. There are some files that were automatically generated in java by the Web3j Library, but those will be converted into Kotlin as i want this project to be 100% Kotlin.
- The databse uses Room, and DAOs are used to communicate with the Database.
- Repositories are responsible for managing Cached data, databse communications, and fetching data from the Web.
- Managers use the Repositories and other injected classes to abstract business logic.
- ViewModels fetch results from Managers & Repositories, updating LiveData, which is observed by the UI components, and used to update the screen.

# Recruiters:
Check out the following components that i think are pretty cool.

**Encryption:**
- Master Key Created when [App](https://github.com/iChillieman/ChillieWalletAndroid/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/chillieman/chilliewallet/ChillieApplication.kt#L48) is created for first time:
- Dagger [Provides](https://github.com/iChillieman/ChillieWalletAndroid/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/chillieman/chilliewallet/di/ProviderModule.kt#L41) the Master Key and Cipher
- [Encryption Manager](https://github.com/iChillieman/ChillieWalletAndroid/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/chillieman/chilliewallet/manager/EncryptionManager.kt) is used to easily decrypt and encrypt text. 
 - Manager is used by [AuthRepository](https://github.com/iChillieman/ChillieWalletAndroid/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/chillieman/chilliewallet/repository/AuthRepository.kt#L30) to secure any sensative data that interacts with the database.

**Auth Lockout:**
- While using this app, you must be authenticated using a PIN code.
- [AuthManager](https://github.com/iChillieman/ChillieWalletAndroid/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/chillieman/chilliewallet/manager/AuthManager.kt#L25) is responsible for maintaining the Authentication state of a user. 
- [AuthService is always watching the clock](https://github.com/iChillieman/ChillieWalletAndroid/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/chillieman/chilliewallet/service/AuthService.kt#L40), waiting for time to run out
- [MainActivity will launch the AuthActivity](https://github.com/iChillieman/ChillieWalletAndroid/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/chillieman/chilliewallet/ui/main/MainActivity.kt#L50), preventing use of the app until the correct pincode is entered.
